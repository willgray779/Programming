/*
for this one, if you remember, I asked you to come up with a 'reason' for a function and implement it. 
Now you get to do it! yay!!!!!
please go a little more complex than just simple math/simple printing for the function
feel free to google some inspiration though :)
*/
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.println("give me a word, or string of words");
    String word = sc.nextLine();
        int characters = count(word);
        System.out.println(word + " has " + characters + " letters");
    }

    
    public static int count(String input) 
    {
    int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < input.length(); i++) 
//this runs thru the whole input whether thats a sentence, or a word
        {
            char j = input.charAt(i);
//"char" j looks for the character at i, and if that is a letter, as seen in the function below, it will increase count
//I learned that char is like int or string
            if (Character.isLetter(j)) 
//I googled this function to check if characters are letters
//this will only count letters in words, not spaces if u give a sentence 
            {  
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
