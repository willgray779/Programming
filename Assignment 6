//I have to add the plus 1 outside of the thing bc i kept running it and getting 0 bc the range was 0-4 bc the first 5 int's in computer language start at 0
//the plus one makes it 1-5, and it has to be outside the parenthesis

//i put both classes in this same repository, but on vs code, they are on the separate tabs things that you showed us in class
//i also didnt put the functcion call for every student in my app which is my main
//if you wanted to do it for every student, youd just put student whatever dot whatever function you want
//for this assignment, i learned how to make a class, and function within that class that runs code to check criteria about the class, for example checking if theyre honors, or free lunch
//i also learned how to use random.nextint.  i thought getting a random number would be easier, but that lowkey took like 15 mins and a few google searches
