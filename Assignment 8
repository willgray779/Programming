// i learned in this what a parse double does.  I did not not that if u have a text file the numbers like the gpas in this one are strings, and need to be converted to do comparisons with other numbers
// I also learned how to set up code to read the file with the gpa being below the name as opposed to it being on the same line.  It was actually pretty easy
//the while just kept running while there were more lines, and i just took the name, then moved to the gpa below it and scanned tht
